                <p dir="ltr"><span>If you own a 1996–2002 Toyota 4Runner, you already know it’s one of the most reliable SUVs ever built. From daily commutes to rugged trails, the 3rd gen 4Runner continues to earn respect for its durability and timeless style. But when it comes to modern driving needs, the interior wasn’t designed with smartphones in mind. That’s why we created the</span><a href="https://teqcustoms.com/products/96-02-4runner-dash-accessory-mount-dam-phone-mount?_pos=2&amp;_sid=8ab07d757&amp;_ss=r"><span> 1996-2002 4Runner Dash Accessory Mount (DAM) / Phone Mount, </span></a><span>a product built to blend seamlessly into the 3rd gen 4Runner interior while giving you the convenience you expect today.</span></p>
                <p dir="ltr"><span>Instead of juggling flimsy suction cup mounts or sticking adhesives that never last, this mount delivers a secure, permanent-feeling solution without damaging your dash. At </span><span>TEQ Customs</span><span>, we’ll walk you through why this product was made, what makes it different, and why it’s the ultimate upgrade for any 3rd gen 4Runner owner.</span></p>

                <h2 dir="ltr"><span>Built Specifically for the 3rd Gen 4Runner Driver</span></h2>
                <p dir="ltr"><span>We created this phone mount because universal solutions just don’t cut it. They either block your view, slide off on hot days, or rattle loose the moment you hit a rough patch of road. That’s frustrating and unsafe.</span></p>
                <p dir="ltr"><span>The 3rd gen 4Runner deserved something better, something engineered to fit the unique lines and design of its dashboard. Our Dash Accessory Mount gives you a factory-style fit that looks like it belongs there. No gaps, no clutter, just clean integration that improves your driving experience without changing the essence of your SUV.</span></p>
                <h2 dir="ltr"><span>What Makes This Mount Stand Out</span></h2>

                <h2 dir="ltr"><span>Why We Trust This Mount Over Generic Options</span></h2>

                <p dir="ltr" role="presentation"><span>● The </span><span>peace of mind</span><span> that comes from using a mount tested by real 4Runner owners</span></p>
                <p dir="ltr"><span>We didn’t just build it, we use it ourselves. That’s how we know it works.</span></p>

                <p dir="ltr"><span>Not everyone needs the same kind of mount, and we get that. That’s why this product was made specifically with 4Runner owners in mind.</span></p>
                <p dir="ltr" role="presentation"><span>● Daily commuters</span><span> who need safe phone access</span><span><br><br></span></p>
                <p dir="ltr" role="presentation"><span>● Weekend adventurers</span><span> who rely on maps and trail apps</span><span><br><br></span></p>
